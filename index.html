      Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama is an American lawyer,
      university administrator, and writer, who was the first 
      lady of the United States of America from 2009 to 2017.She is married to the 44th President of
      the United States, Barack Obama, and she was the first African American First Lady of the 
      United States. <br>
      <br><br>
      Michelle Obama is a figure every woman in this century 
      aspire to be, someone who grew up in a working class
      black community on the south of side of Chicago, and attended 
      Princeton university then Harvard Law School through
      sheer determination and hard work.
      A modern embodiment of the American dream and a hero to all women all over the world.
      And her book 'BECOMING'  has started a conversation about what it 
      is to be a woman and how as women our stories are essential for
      others to learn and thrive. I am very here for you, Michelle Obama!
